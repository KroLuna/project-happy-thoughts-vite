# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I still have the problem to understand how to connect the components and where to right what. So I looked again at the material, I ask my team and chatGPT. I tried to solve the first strech goal but I became to hard to solve and I decided not to do it. If I had more time I would have done the strech goals.
